## 📜 Project Description  
This project is a **simple decentralized coin flip guessing game** implemented as a **Clarity smart contract** on the **Stacks Testnet**.  
Two players: Player 1 picks Heads or Tails secretly, Player 2 guesses it. The winner is declared transparently and trustlessly — **all logic runs on-chain!**

## 🔭 Project Vision  
> To **showcase the power of Clarity** and how simple interactive games can be built trustlessly on the blockchain.  
> Encourage blockchain gaming innovation beyond tokens & DeFi.
